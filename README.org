* My Org-Mode Configuration
**Deprecation notice: I've experimentally switched to an Org-based personal configuration, so I am not using this configuration now.**

This is my configuration for Emacs Org mode.

It has been separated from [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d][my Emacs configuration]], as most changes in the Org configuration are unlikely to be of interest to a few watching users of the main configuration repository.

** Prerequisites
- Emacs 26.1
- [[https://github.com/akirak/org-starter][org-starter]]
- [[https://github.com/akirak/org-reverse-datetree][org-reverse-datetree]]
- Possibly some functions in my [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d][emacs.d]] repository
